SQLi Vulnerability Scanner
Description

SQLi Vulnerability Scanner is a Python tool designed to detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It parses URLs, extracts parameters, and sends requests with modified parameter values to identify SQL injection patterns in the HTTP response. This tool is intended for security testing purposes and should only be used on systems where you have explicit permission to test for vulnerabilities.
Usage

The SQLi Vulnerability Scanner can be used to assess the security posture of web applications by scanning them for SQL injection vulnerabilities. By providing a target URL, the tool extracts parameters from the URL, crafts malicious payloads, and sends requests to the target server. The HTTP responses are then analyzed for indicators of SQL injection vulnerabilities.
